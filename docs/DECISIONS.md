# DECISIONS.md — append-only decision log

New entries go at the bottom. Never edit or delete an old entry;
supersede it with a new one that references it.

## 2026-07-24 — pgvector over a dedicated vector DB
Postgres is already required for the symbol graph, FTS, and job state.
pgvector keeps hybrid RRF fusion in one SQL query and removes an entire
service. Rejected: Qdrant, Chroma.

## 2026-07-24 — ARQ over Celery
The codebase is async end-to-end; ARQ is Redis-native and async-first
with minimal configuration. Rejected: Celery (sync-first, heavy config),
Dramatiq, Postgres-as-queue.

## 2026-07-24 — SSE over WebSockets
Streaming is one-directional server→client. SSE survives proxies and
simplifies both ends. Chat is POST with a streamed text/event-stream
response consumed via fetch/ReadableStream — not GET/EventSource.

## 2026-07-24 — Plain numbered SQL migrations over Alembic
Project size doesn't justify Alembic. `NNN_*.sql` applied in order by
`scripts/migrate.py` against a `schema_migrations` table. Applied
migrations are never edited — only appended.

## 2026-07-24 — Repo file contents stored in Postgres; clone is ephemeral
After ingestion, file text lives in the `files` table; `read_file`,
`list_directory`, and the frontend viewer all serve from the DB. No
persistent disk is needed for serving. The clone dir is deleted in a
`finally` block.

## 2026-07-24 — File selection starts from `git ls-files`
Tracked files inherit .gitignore semantics for free; we never
reimplement gitignore matching. Our own filters (SPEC §2.2) apply on
top of the tracked set.

## 2026-07-24 — "Called by" attached at context-assembly time, not embedded
Chunk headers embed only file/symbol/signature/file-level imports.
Caller information is appended when chunks enter the agent context
(SPEC §7.4). Keeps embeddings stable as the graph changes and avoids
re-embedding passes.

## 2026-07-24 — Shallow clone (depth 1)
Commit-history indexing is deferred to v2, so v1 clones with
`--depth 1 --single-branch`.

## 2026-07-24 — Symbol uses the full dotted qualname everywhere
SPEC §2.4's example header previously showed a class-relative symbol
(`AuthMiddleware.verify_token`), which contradicted §3's definition of
`qualname` as the full dotted path (`pkg.module.Class.method`).
Reconciled in favor of the **full dotted qualname everywhere**: both
chunk `symbol` fields and header `Symbol:` lines carry it. Module-path
rule: `a/b/c.py` → `a.b.c`, `a/b/__init__.py` → `a.b`; a module chunk's
symbol is that module path, a method's is `<module>.<Class>.<method>`.
Edited the §2.4 example to match.

## 2026-07-24 — Heuristic token counter in Phase 1 (len//4)
The real embedding tokenizer ships with sentence-transformers in Phase 2
(native deps we are not installing in Phase 1). Phase 1's oversize-split
logic (SPEC §2.5) needs a `token_len`, so `app/ingest/tokens.py` provides
a `TokenCounter` protocol with a `HeuristicTokenCounter` (`len(text)//4`).
Phase 2 swaps in the model tokenizer via the same protocol and re-checks
oversize splits against `CHUNK_TOKEN_MAX`. Chunk boundaries (AST nodes)
are unaffected — only the oversize threshold is approximate until then.

## 2026-07-24 — Phase 1 benchmark repo: encode/httpx
Picked `encode/httpx` as the pinned benchmark: well-known, mid-size, pure
Python, clean package layout, exercises decorators/async/classes. Fallback
`pallets/flask` if httpx fails structurally. SHA recorded in docs/EVAL.md
when the benchmark run is approved.

## 2026-07-24 — Phase 2 blocked on this host by WDAC; backend moves machines
**What failed.** Phase 2's Gate B: `import torch` (the backend for
`sentence-transformers`, used for both embeddings and the reranker) raised
`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _C: An Application Control
policy has blocked this file.` The block happens at import of torch's
compiled `_C` extension, *before* any model download — so it is a Windows
Application Control (WDAC) policy block, not a network/HuggingFace issue.
Gate A (Postgres via Neon) passed; Gate C (reranker, ~2 GB) was not run
because it rides on the same torch backend and would fail identically.

**Why no workaround.** The Phase 2 prompt's Gate B rule is explicit: a
DLL/policy error means stop, not improvise. CPU-only wheel swaps, vendored
builds, code-signing, or substituting a non-torch embedder would all either
violate the locked stack (CLAUDE.md) or the frozen retrieval design, so none
was attempted.

**Contrast with Phase 1.** tree-sitter's native extension passed the same
class of gate and loaded fine under WDAC; torch did not. WDAC blocks specific
unsigned native binaries (ruff and mypyc in Phase 0, torch here) while
allowing others (tree-sitter) — so "native" alone doesn't predict the block.

**Resolution.** Backend development moves to an unrestricted machine (WSL2 or
another host) where torch's native libs are permitted. The database is
unaffected: Neon is cloud-hosted, so the same `DATABASE_URL` works unchanged
from the new environment. Phase 2 deps are pre-staged in pyproject/uv.lock so
the move is a `uv sync` away. ROADMAP Phase 2 stays "not started".
